# Tic Tac Toe Game

In this project we built a Tic Tac Toe game that can be played by two players using the commandline.

## Built With

- Ruby

## Getting Started

- To make a copy of the project on your local machine, you can either download the project files in a zip folder or type 'git clone' into your git commandline followed by the URL of this repository.

- Once you have copied the project to your local machine, open your terminal in the project directory and run the project by typing 'bin\main.rb' into the terminal.

## Game Instructions and Rules

- After both players enter their names, they will be allowed to take turns in marking a spot on the board either with an "X" (when it's the turn of player 1) or with an "O" (when it's the turn of player 2).

- At the start of every turn the board will be displayed as a square grid (3 x 3) consisting of nine numbered spaces (marked from 0 - 8). In order to make a mark on the grid, a player must enter the number corresponding to the spot on the grid that they wish to mark.

- In order to win the game, a player must form a straight line with three marks (of Xs or of Os) on the board. This line can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.

- Once a spot is marked on the board it cannot be marked again. Any attempt at doing this is an invalid move.
